            <!-- <img id="avatar" src="../homepage/image/photo/avatar.jpg"> -->
            <p>I'm a master's graduate in Social Studies of Gender majoring in Sociology. Besides doing my research work in the academia, I also have a great interest in technology and have been learning how to code.</p> 
            <p>I love to create and make things beautiful. I play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulusi">Hulusi</a> at the professional level, and I enjoy film photography, classical guitar, painting and cats.

                <h3>Technology is a medium of power.</h3>
                <h5 id="cite-heading"> – Cynthia Cockburn, <i>Machinery of Dominance</i></h5>
            </div>
            <p>I believe in gender equality and social justice, especially in modern society where technology can be a means of empowerment for the marginalized. At the same time, if technology is not handled well, it can cause inequality issues.</p>
            <p>With my academical background, analytical skills and technical sophistication, I have done research in the field of Feminist studies, Asian Studies, Science and Technology Studies (STS) using both qualitative and quantatative research methods.
