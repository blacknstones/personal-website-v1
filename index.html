            <p>To combine my interest in programming with my sociological research, I am currently working on a project focusing on immigrant female in Sweden who are learning to code. <br>It's a qualitative study which explores women's intersectional experience
                in the tech sector and the underrepresentation of women in this male-dominated field.
