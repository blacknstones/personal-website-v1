            <p>I'm a master's student in Social Studies of Gender with the main research interest in <strong>gender and technology</strong>, and a newbie of the coding world who are eager to learn new things.</p>
            <p>I love cats, enjoy taking pictures and making things beautiful. I play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulusi">Hulusi</a> at the professional level, also I'm learning classical guitar and watercolor painting in my spare time.

            <p>To combine my interest in programming with my sociological research, I am currently working on a project focusing on immigrant female in Sweden who are learning to code. <br>It's a qualitative study which explores women's intersectional experience
                in the tech sector and the underrepresentation of women in this male-dominated field.
